I am an economist at the U.S. Census Bureau. I received my Ph.D. in economics from Purdue University in 2016. My primary research fields are labor economics, applied econometrics, and the economics of privacy. My current research includes work on minimum wages, education, and data privacy.

I work in the Center for Enterprise Dissemination - Disclosure Avoidance in the Research & Methodology Directorate at the U.S. Census Bureau. [Our work](https://www.census.gov/library/working-papers/series/ced-wp.html) involves the application of disclosure avoidance mechanisms to Census data products and the evaluation of their effects on privacy and utility.

Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
